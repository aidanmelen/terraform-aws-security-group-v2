  ## Examples

  ### Complete

  Please see the [Complete Example](examples/complete) for more information.

  ### Security group with managed rules

  {{ include "examples/managed_rules/.main.tf.docs" }}
  ```

  Please see the [Managed Rules Example](examples/managed_rules) for more information.

  ### Security group with custom rules

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/custom_rules/.main.tf.docs" }}
  ```

  Please see the [Custom Rules Example](examples/rules) for more information.

  ### Only rules with pre-existing security group

  ```hcl
  {{ include "examples/rules_only/.main.tf.docs" }}
  ```

  Please see the [Rules Only Example](examples/rules_only) for more information.

  ## Limitations

  The following module security group rule arguments must be known before the first Terraform apply:

  - `cidr_blocks`
  - `ipv6_cidr_blocks`
  - `prefix_list_ids`
  - `source_security_group_id`

  They can be dynamic after the first Terraform apply.

  ## Tests

  Run Terratest using the [Makefile](./Makefile) targets:
  1. `make setup`
  2. `make tests`

  ### Results

  ```
  {{ include "test/.terratest.docs" }}
  ```

  ## Makefile Targets
